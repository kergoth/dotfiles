# TODO

- Consider importing pyenv/nvm/stack/etc with peru rather than having the install
  scripts clone them to other locations
- Move to XDG paths where possible

  - .gist - [Pending](https://github.com/defunkt/gist/pull/189)
  - .mitmproxy

## System Setup Scripts

- In addition to install-{cabal,node,python,pipsi} and rustup, there's also
  authentication for asciinema, gist, and hub to do on a new system

## Reference

- [XDG Base Directory support](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/XDG_Base_Directory_support)
