# TODO

- tmux

  - Swipe recent useful bits from some other folks tmux.conf
  - Handle xclip vs pbpaste/pbcopy, likely via wrapper script(s)

- Consider importing pyenv/nvm/stack/etc with peru rather than having the install
  scripts clone them to other locations

## System Setup Scripts

- In addition to install-{cabal,node,python,pipsi} and rustup, there's also
  authentication for asciinema, gist, and hub to do on a new system
