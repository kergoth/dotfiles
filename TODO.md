# TODO

- Add one-time or once-a-day init functionality at login. Sync dotfiles, etc.
  Also consider setting up an agent with `keychain` if one isn't already
  running.
- zsh: alter `fo` and `fv` functions to accept base path as `$2`. Be conscious
  of the fact that the paths may be returned as relative
