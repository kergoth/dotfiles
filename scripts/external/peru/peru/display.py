# The display classes deal with output from subprocesses. The FancyDisplay
# gives a multi-line, real-time view of each running process that looks nice in
# the terminal. The VerboseDisplay collects output from each job and prints it
# all when the job is finished, in a way that's suitable for logs. The
# QuietDisplay prints nothing.
#
# All of the display types inherit from BaseDisplay and provide the same
# interface. Callers use get_handle() to get a display handle for each
# subprocess job that's going to run. The handle is used as a context manager
# (inside a with statement) to indicate when the job is starting and stopping,
# and all of the output from the subprocess is passed to the handle's write()
# method. There is also a print() method on the display, for output that's not
# tied to a particular job, which prints to the terminal in a way that won't
# get stomped on by FancyDisplay's redrawing.
#
# Like other errors, we handle job errors by throwing a PrintableError, which
# get caught in main. So the displays don't need to do anything special to show
# errors.
