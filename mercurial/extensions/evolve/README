=============================
Mutable History For Mercurial
=============================

This package supplies the ``evolve`` extension for Mercurial, which
provides several commands to mutate history and deal with the
resulting issues.

It also:

    - enables the "changeset obsolescence" feature of Mercurial
    - issues several warning messages when trouble appears in your repository

**This extension is experimental and not yet meant for production.**

You can enable it by adding the line below to the ``extensions``
section of your hgrc::

    evolve = PATH/TO/evolve-main/hgext/evolve.py

We recommend reading the documentation first. An online version is
available here:

    https://www.mercurial-scm.org/doc/evolution/

Or see the ``doc/`` directory for a local copy.

==========

Bugs are to be reported on the mercurial's bug tracker (component: evolution):
https://bz.mercurial-scm.org/buglist.cgi?component=evolution&query_format=advanced&resolution=---

Please use the patchbomb extension to send email to mercurial devel. Please
make sure to use the evolve-ext flag when doing so. You can use a command like
this:

    hg email --to mercurial-devel@mercurial-scm.org --flag evolve-ext --rev '<your patches>'

See also
http://mercurial-scm.org/wiki/ContributingChanges#Patch_descriptions
for guidelines on the patch description.

Please don't forget to update and run the tests when you fix a bug or
add a feature. To run the tests, you need a working copy of Mercurial,
say in $HGSRC:

    cd tests
    python $HGSRC/tests/run-tests.py --with-hg=$HGSRC/hg

(evolve's stable and default branches correspond to Mercurial's stable
and default branches. So to test evolve from default, you need
Mercurial on default.)
