=============================
Mutable History For Mercurial
=============================

This package supplies the ``evolve`` extension for Mercurial, which
provides several commands to mutate history and deal with the
resulting issues.

It also:

    - enables the "changeset obsolescence" feature of Mercurial
    - issues several warning messages when trouble appears in your repository

**This extension is experimental and not yet meant for production.**

You can enable it by adding the line below to the ``extensions``
section of your hgrc::

    evolve = PATH/TO/mutable-history/hgext/evolve.py

We recommend reading the documentation first. An online version is
available here:

    http://evolution.experimentalworks.net/doc/

Or see the ``doc/`` directory for a local copy.
