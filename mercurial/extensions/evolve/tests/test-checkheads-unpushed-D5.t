====================================
Testing head checking code: Case D-5
====================================

Mercurial checks for the introduction of multiple heads on push. Evolution
comes into play to detect if existing heads on the server are being replaced by
some of the new heads we push.

This test file is part of a series of tests checking this behavior.

Category D: remote head is "obs-affected" locally, but result is not part of the push.
TestCase 5: multi-changeset branch, split on multiple other, (head on its own new branch)

.. old-state:
..
.. * 2 branch (1 changeset, and 2 changesets)
..
.. new-state:
..
.. * 1 new branch superceeding the head of the old-2-changesets-branch,
.. * 1 new changesets on the old-1-changeset-branch superceeding the base of the other
..
.. expected-result:
..
.. * push the new branch only -> push denied
.. * push the existing branch only -> push allowed
..   /!\ This push create unstability/orphaning on the other hand and we should
..  probably detect/warn agains that.
