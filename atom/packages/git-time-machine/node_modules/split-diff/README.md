### Settings

* **Show Word Diff** - Diffs the words between each line when this box is checked.
* **Ignore Whitespace** - Will not diff whitespace when this box is checked.
* **Mute Notifications** - Mutes all warning notifications when this box is checked.
* **Sync Scrolling** - Syncs the scrolling of the editors.
* **Left Editor Color** - Specifies the highlight color for the left editor.
* **Right Editor Color** - Specifies the highlight color for the right editor.

### Customization
The highlighting for this package uses global UI variables defined in your syntax theme. The variables are `@syntax-color-added`, `@syntax-color-removed`, `@syntax-color-modified`, and `@syntax-gutter-background-color-selected` (for the blank spacers between lines). Make sure your theme defines these, so it is compatible with this package!

To override these colors in your `styles.less`, write selectors for `.split-diff-added`, `.split-diff-removed`, `.split-diff-selected`, and/or `.split-diff-offset`. For instance:

```
.split-diff-added {
  background-color: fade(blue, 40%) !important;
}
```
