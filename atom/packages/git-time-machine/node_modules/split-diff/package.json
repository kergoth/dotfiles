  "readme": "# split-diff package\n\nDiffs text between two split panes. New panes are created if less than two panes exist upon run of the package.\n\n\\*\\* **Supports diffing recent git changes!** \\*\\*\n\n![Split Diff in action](https://github.com/mupchrch/split-diff/raw/master/demo.gif)\n\n## Usage\n\n### Commands\n\nYou can call any of these commands from your own custom keybinding, simply override the command in your keymap.cson!\n\n| Command | Effect | Default Keymaps |\n| ------- | ------ | --------------- |\n| Toggle `split-diff:toggle` | Toggles a diff of the text between two side-by-side panes. Creates panes as necessary. Displays git changes if there is a repository found. | `ctrl-alt-t` |\n| Enable `split-diff:enable` | Enables a diff of the text between two side-by-side panes. Creates panes as necessary. Displays git changes if there is a repository found. | ... |\n| Disable `split-diff:disable` | Disables a diff. Removes any panes that were created by this package. | ... |\n| Ignore Whitespace `split-diff:ignore-whitespace` | Toggles the Ignore Whitespace setting. | ... |\n| Move to Next Diff `split-diff:next-diff` | Highlights the next difference. Moves the cursor so it can be easily copied. | `ctrl-alt-n` |\n| Move to Previous Diff `split-diff:prev-diff` | Highlights the previous difference. Moves the cursor so it can be easily copied. | `ctrl-alt-p` |\n| Copy to Right `split-diff:copy-to-right` | Copies all differences containing a cursor to the right pane. | `ctrl-alt-.` |\n| Copy to Left `split-diff:copy-to-left` | Copies all differences containing a cursor to the left pane. | `ctrl-alt-,` |\n\n### Settings\n\n* **Show Word Diff** - Diffs the words between each line when this box is checked.\n* **Ignore Whitespace** - Will not diff whitespace when this box is checked.\n* **Mute Notifications** - Mutes all warning notifications when this box is checked.\n* **Sync Scrolling** - Syncs the scrolling of the editors.\n* **Left Editor Color** - Specifies the highlight color for the left editor.\n* **Right Editor Color** - Specifies the highlight color for the right editor.\n\n### Customization\nThe highlighting for this package uses global UI variables defined in your syntax theme. The variables are `@syntax-color-added`, `@syntax-color-removed`, `@syntax-color-modified`, and `@syntax-gutter-background-color-selected` (for the blank spacers between lines). Make sure your theme defines these, so it is compatible with this package!\n\nTo override these colors in your `styles.less`, write selectors for `.split-diff-added`, `.split-diff-removed`, `.split-diff-selected`, and/or `.split-diff-offset`. For instance:\n\n```\n.split-diff-added {\n  background-color: fade(blue, 40%) !important;\n}\n```\n\n## Minimap Plugin\n\nGet the [Split Diff minimap plugin](https://atom.io/packages/minimap-split-diff) to make it easier to spot differences!\n",
