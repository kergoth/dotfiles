###
  this is the expected data for the first five commits of test-data/fiveCommits.txt.
  Only the keys in these objects are tested against the actual first five commits read
  from git log

  this should remain static, but if you need to redo, use bin/gitLogJson.coffee test/lib/fiveCommits.txt
  and replace array below with pasted output
