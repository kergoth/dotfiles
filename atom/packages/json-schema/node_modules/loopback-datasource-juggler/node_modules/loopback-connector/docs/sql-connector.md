Use the loopback-connector module to build a LoopBack connector to back-end data sources
such as databases or web services.  There are many existing connectors for the most popular data sources; see:
- [Database connectors](http://docs.strongloop.com/display/LB/Database+connectors) (for example, MongoDB, MySQL, Oracle).
- [Non-database connectors](http://docs.strongloop.com/display/LB/Non-database+connectors) (for example, REST, SOAP).

To build a new data source connector that doesn't yet exist, please see [Building a connector for a relational database](http://docs.strongloop.com/display/LB/Building+a+connector+for+a+relational+database).
