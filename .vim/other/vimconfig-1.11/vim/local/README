Directory ~/.vim/local/ is for your own ~/.vimrc files.
You can put here machine or user specific configuration files.


EXAMPLE:
--------

      At server platon.sk will user 'rajo' set variable 'g:company'
      to "Platon SDG". He don't will change anything in '~/.vimrc',
      because he is using the same config file at server orbital.sk.
      Therefore he creates file '~/.vim/local/vimrc-platon' and put
      in then:

          let g:company="Platon SDG"

      If user 'ondrej' at server maxim.sk will set 'g:company' to
      "Condy Software", he put in '~/.vim/local/vimrc-ondrej' (or
      '~/.vim/local/vimrc-maxim') this line:

          let g:company="Condy Software"
