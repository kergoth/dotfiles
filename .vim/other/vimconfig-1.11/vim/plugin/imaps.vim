" Description: insert mode template expander with cursor placement
"              while preserving filetype indentation.
" Last Change: Thu Mar 21 05:00 AM 2002 PST

" Documentation: {{{
" TODO: This documentation is obsolete right now!!
" this script provides a way to generate insert mode mappings which do not
" suffer from some of the problem of mappings and abbreviations while allowing
" cursor placement after the expansion. It can alternatively be thought of as
" a template expander. 
"
" Consider an example. If you do
"
" imap lhs something
"
" then a mapping is set up. However, there will be the following problems:
" 1. the 'ttimeout' option will generally limit how easily you can type the
"    lhs. if you type the left hand side too slowly, then the mapping will not
"    be activated.
" 2. if you mistype one of the letters of the lhs, then the mapping is
"    deactivated as soon as you backspace to correct the mistake.
"
" If, in order to take care of the above problems, you do instead
"
" iab lhs something
"
" then the timeout problem is solved and so is the problem of mistyping.
" however, abbreviations are only expanded after typing a non-word character.
" which causes problems of cursor placement after the expansion and invariably
" spurious spaces are inserted.
"
" this script attempts to solve all these problems by providing an emulation
" of imaps wchich does not suffer from its attendant problems. Because maps
" are activated without having to press additional characters, therefore
" cursor placement is possible. furthermore, file-type specific indentation is
" preserved, because the rhs is expanded as if the rhs is typed in literally
" by the user.
"  
" The script already provides some default mappings. each "mapping" is of the
" form:
"
" let s:<filetype>_<lhs> = "rhs"
"
" Consider a working example:
"
" let s:tex_bit  = "\\begin{itemize}\<cr>\\item הה\<cr>\\end{itemize}"
" 
" This effectively sets up the map
" 
" imap bit<leader>
"
" whenever you edit a latex file. i.e, if you type the leader character ('\'
" by default), after the word 'bit', then its expanded as follows:
"
" \begin{itemize}
" \item *
" \end{itemize}
"
" where * shows the cursor position. The special characters "הה" (typed as
" CTRL-K + a + :) decides the cursor placement after the expansion. If there
" is no "הה", then the cursor is left at the end.
"
" however, unlike in mappings, it is not necessary to enter the keys
" b,i,t,<leader> in quick succession. this works by just mapping the last
" character, which is chosen to be <leader> instead of all the characters. a
" check is then made to see if the characters entered before match the total
" LHS of the required mapping.
" 
" NOTE: some functions may confuse user. Therefore if exists variable
" "g:disable_imap" or "b:disable_imap" and is set to ":let g:disable_imap=1",
" all functions returns ASAP. This feature was added by Lubomir Host 'rajo'
" <rajo AT platon.sk>
" 
" NOTE: There are other plugins out there which do the same thing. For
" example, Dr. Chip's Cabbr script at 
"    http://users.erols.com/astronaut/vim/index.html#CAbbrv
" However, this script is a bit more general in that mappings for various file
" types can be put in the same place and also, instead of having to extend a
" function by putting additional 'if ...' lines, you directly type in
" additional mappings as variables.
" 
"--------------------------------------%<--------------------------------------
" Bonus: This script also provides a command Snip which puts tearoff strings,
" '----%<----' above and below the visually selected range of lines. The
" length of the string is chosen to be equal to the longest line in the range.
"--------------------------------------%<--------------------------------------

" IMAP: Adds a "fake" insert mode mapping. {{{
"       For example, doing
"           IMAP('abc', 'def') 
"       will mean that if the letters abc are pressed in insert mode, then
"       they will be replaced by def. however, it has a few changes
"       (improvements ?) over simply doing:
"           imap abc def
"       1. with imap, if you begin typing abc, the cursor will not advance and
"          long as there is a possible completion, the letters a, b, c will be
"          displayed on top of the other. using this function avoids that.
"       2. with imap, if a backspace or arrow key is pressed before completing
"          the word, then the mapping is lost. this function allows movement. 
"          (this ofcourse means that this function is only limited to
"          left-hand-sides which do not have movement keys or unprintable
"          characters)
"       It works by only mapping the last character of the left-hand side.
"       when this character is typed in, then a reverse lookup is done and if
"       the previous characters consititute the left hand side of the mapping,
"       the previously typed characters and erased and the right hand side is
"       inserted.
