" Summary: Vim plugin for transparent editing of gpg encrypted files.
" TODO enable signing
" TODO GPGOptions for encrypting, signing, auto fetch ..
" Section: Documentation {{{1
" Description:
"   
"   This script implements transparent editing of gpg public/private-key
"   encrypted files. The filename must have a ".gpg" suffix. When opening such
"   a file the content is decrypted, when opening a new file the script will
"   ask for the recipients of the encrypted file. The file content will be
"   encrypted to all recipients before it is written. The script turns off
"   viminfo and swapfile to increase security.
"
" Installation: 
"
"   Copy the gnupg.vim file to the $HOME/.vim/plugin directory.
"   Refer to ':help add-plugin', ':help add-global-plugin' and ':help
"   runtimepath' for more details about Vim plugins.
"
" Commands:
"
"   :GPGEditRecipients
"     Opens a scratch buffer to change the list of recipients. Recipients that
"     are unknown (not in your public key) are highlighted and have a
"     prepended "!". Closing the buffer with :x or :bd makes the changes permanent.
"
"   :GPGViewRecipients
"     Prints the list of recipients.
