* I can't use multiple threads ( vim just hangs ) so I need to find
  a way to continue to get output in the background for commands that
  take a while to post stuff to stdout.  This would also fix the clean
  up after ctrl-c.  This issue is the the single biggest limitation
  of this script.  Without multiple threads or some notification scheme
  constant output can't be read and also allow for keyboard input.
  See vimsh.vim for an explanation of what I've tried so far and hasn't
  worked.

* Get ctrl-c working on Windows, commands like 'findstr foo' hang.

* verify ctrl-d on solaris works

* Ctrl-D/EOF not working on BSD for /bin/sh.


* How to handle stderr inline with stdout? popen4?

* Handle ( syntax hi ) ansi escape sequences ( colored prompts, LS_COLORS ).

* Add hooks for write/read so scripts can ride on top of this one.
  i.e. GDB run in terminal buffer, script hooks write read etc parses
  output, and uses glyph to highlight current line, for example.

* Support vim/python native to 'cygwin', cygwin seems to support select.

* tab completion

* command history
