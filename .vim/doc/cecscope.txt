2. Installing cecscope					*cecscope-install*

    1. Move/copy cecscope.tar.gz to
        unix/linux: ~/.vim
        Windows   : ...\vimfiles
    2. gunzip cecscope.tar.gz
    3. tar -oxvf cecscope.tar
    4. vim    (this step enables the help)
       :helptags doc
       :q

3. Cescope Manual					*cecscope-manual*

    :CS     [cdefgist]   : cscope
    :CSL[!] [cdefgist]   : locallist style (! restores efm)
    :CSS[!] [cdefgist]   : split window and use cscope
    :CSH                 : give quick help
    :CSR                 : cscope reset

    !            split vertically
    c (calls)    find functions calling function under cursor
    d (called)   find functions called by function under cursor
    e (egrep)    egrep search for the word under cursor
    f (file)     open the file named under cursor
    g (global)   find global definition(s) of word under cursor
    i (includes) find files that #include file named under cursor
    s (symbol)   find all references to the word under cursor
    t (text)     find all instances of the word under cursor

    In addition, when using gvim, there is a menu interface under the
    "DrChip" label with all of the above options mentioned.  The first
    four items are taken from: 

        Help
        Use Messages Display
        Use Horiz Split Display
        Use Vert Split Display
        Use Quickfix Display

    The "Use" method that's currently active will not be present (initially,
    that's the "Use Messages Display").

4. Cescope Tutorial					*cecscope-tutorial*

   GETTING STARTED
    To use this plugin you'll need to have vim 7.0aa, snapshot#188 or later,
    and your version should have +cscope.  To check that latter condition,
    either look for +cscope through the output of >
        :version
<   or type >
        :echo has("cscope")
<   You'll need to recompile your vim if you don't have +cscope.

    BUILDING CSCOPE DATABASE
    Once you have your cscope-enabled vim, then change directory to wherever
    you have some C code.  Type >
        cscope -b *.[ch]
<   and the cscope database will be generated (<cscope.out>).  If you don't
    have a cscope database, the file specified by the environment variable
    named >
        $CSCOPE_DB
<   will be used.  Sadly, otherwise cecscope.vim will issue a warning message.

    SELECTING A DISPLAY MODE

    Assuming you're using gvim: Select >
        DrChip:Cscope:Use Quickfix Display
<   This will make the information from cscope show up in a local quickfix
    window (see |lopen|).  The other modes allow one to see cscope messages
    as regular messages (which will shortly disappear) or in another window.

    USING THE QUICKFIX DISPLAY
    Place your cursor atop some function that you've written: >
        DrChip:Cscope:Find function which calls word under cursor
<   and you'll see a locallist window open up which tells you something like >
        xgrep.c|410 info| <<sprt>> Edbg(("xgrep(%s)",sprt(filename)));
<   To jump to that entry, type >
        :ll
<   To jump to the next entry, type >
        :lne
<   To jump to the previous entry, type >
        :lp
<   You can also switch windows (ex. <ctrl-w>j, see |window-move-cursor|)
    to the locallist window, move the cursor about normally, then hit the
    <cr> to jump to the selection.

    USING THE COMMAND LINE
    You could've done the above using the command line!  Again, just
    place your cursor atop some function that you've written, then type: >
        :CSL c
<   You may use the :ll, :lne, and :lp commands as before.

    HELP
    Just type >
        :CSH
<   for a quick help display.  Of course, you can always type : >
        :help CS
<   too.
