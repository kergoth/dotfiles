2. AsNeeded Manual				*asneeded*

	The AsNeeded plugin transforms plugin use to either automatically
	loading or assisting in loading plugins when they're needed. >

		:AN command     :ANX command
		:AN map         :ANX map
<
	or >

		:AsNeeded command
		:AsNeeded map
<
	Functions are automatically loaded when called using the FuncUndefined
	event that Vim provides.  :AN or :AsNeeded assists with loading
	commands or maps by searching through plugin files placed in >

		.vim/AsNeeded/       (Unix)
		vimfiles\AsNeeded\   (Windows)
<
	for one containing the desired map or command; once found, AsNeeded
	then loads it.

	The ANX command follows successful searches with an attempt to execute
	the requested command or map.

	MAKING ANTAGS				*MakeANtags* *MkAsNeeded*
	For those who have large numbers of scripts in their AsNeeded directory,
	using either >

		:MakeANtags
		:MkAsNeeded
<
	will create a ANtags file in the AsNeeded directory.  This file will then
	be used to quickly look up the requested map, command, or function; the
	usual search of all scripts in the directory will then be bypassed.


==============================================================================
3. AsNeeded Global Variables				*asneeded-var*

   	*g:AsNeededSuccess* : if this variable exists, then AsNeeded
	                      will inform the user of successful loading
			      of AsNeeded functions/commands/mappings.

	*g:AsNeededAutoMake*  : Set this variable to something like "ls -1t"
			      (Linux/Unix) and AsNeeded will automatically
			      invoke |MkAsNeeded| when necessary.  The
			      variable needs to hold a shell command which
			      will generate a time-sorted list of files, most
			      recent first.  If a *.vim file is present in
			      that list before the ANtags file, then AsNeeded
			      will automatically call MakeANtags().  If a
			      file has been removed w/o regenerating ANtags,
			      AsNeeded will (when that function/map/cmd is
			      invoked) detect the problem and re-generate
			      ANtags.

			      Typical settings:
			      	Linux/Unix: /bin/ls -1t
				Windows   : dir /b/a-d/o-d

4. AsNeeded History					*asneeded-history* {{{1

	v15 Sep 21, 2006: * if AsNeeded/ANtags exists, but a file therein was
	                    removed w/o re-generating ANtags, AsNeeded will,
			    if |g:AsNeededAutoMake| exists, re-make the
			    ANtags file.  A message will be issued
			    irregardless and settings restored.
			  * As Bill McCarthy pointed out, I intended for
			    g:AsNeedeAutoMake to also source the resulting
			    ANtags file; unfortunately, it was still sourcing
			    the previous one.  Fixed!
	    Sep 25, 2006  * fnamemodify() used instead of a substitute to
			    get the directory name holding ANtags.
			    (Bill McCarthy)
			  * AsNeeded now handles silent[!] before commands
			    during :MkAsNeeded
	    Feb 22, 2007  * v15h addressed having no mapleader with a map defined as
			    \abc (ie.the map itself has that leading backslash).
	    Feb 23, 2007  * v15i handles having no mapleader but the maps are
			    <Leader>abc style. (done at prodding of B McCarthy!)
	v14 Jul 31, 2006: * Taglist does a quick-loading trick that involved
	                    using FuncUndefined autocmds.  AsNeeded now defers
			    to taglist instead of issuing a warning.
			  * ei=all was inadvertently being left on; thus no
			    autocmds were operational after AsNeeded 
			    successfully loaded a function.  Fixed!
			  * included |'patchmode'| in the SaveSettings() and
			    RestoreSettings() bypass functions
			  * |g:AsNeededAutoMake| support implemented
			    (Z Sekera's suggestion)
	v13 Mar 23, 2006: * The search for a map wasn't looking for
	                    <Leader>amap when asked for :ANX \amap ; instead,
			    AsNeeded was incorrectly looking for <Leader>\amap.
			    Fixed.
			  * AsNeeded's successful loading message managed to
			    disappear from view (again).  I've deferred
			    showing it until the end of the function.
			  * Used Thomas's idea for ANcmds.vim plugin
			    generation, which sets up skeleton commands.
	v12 Mar 07, 2006: * AsNeeded now saves and restores settings in such
	                    a way that if a command/map/script-sourcing
			    changes vim settings it will be retained, instead
			    of whatever settings were in effect when AsNeeded
			    was first invoked
	v11 Jan 03, 2006  * Bugfix -- AsNeeded's success message sometimes
	                    caused an error because srchstring didn't exist
	    Jan 25, 2006  * internally used temporary buffers now wiped out
	                    silently
	    Feb 10, 2006: * keeps/restores lz option
	v10 Aug 08, 2005: * Bugfix -- maps with backslashes are escaped
	    Aug 17, 2005  * report option workaround
	v9 Mar 15, 2005 : * MakeANtags command search pattern improved
			  * MakeANtags' function search pattern improved
	   Apr 22, 2005   * maps beginning with a backslash needed one extra
	                    leading backslash in their search pattern for ANtags
	v8 Feb 16, 2005 : * With MakeANtags, AsNeeded's search pattern needed
			    to use \\| instead of \|
	v7 Feb 16, 2005 : * MakeANtags now warns the user when no tags were
			    found in some vim-script file 
			  * MakeANtags would occasionally miss certain maps
			    when making ANtags
			  * MakeANtags was omitting the backslashes in
			    Windows paths
	v6 Sep 20, 2004 : * bug left in debugging code fixed
	   Dec 29, 2004   * wipes out temporarily used buffers
	   Feb 09, 2005   * MakeANtags and ANtags support included
	v5 Aug 06, 2004 : * ANX cmd [args] now accepted.
	                  * improved command vs map detection: uses maparg()
			  * ANX bugfix, now detects maps vs commands and attempts
			    to execute them appropriately
	v4 Jul 12, 2004 : * bugfix: somewhen the AsNeeded loading of commands
			    got dropped.
	v3 May 19, 2004 : * bugfix: now works correctly when mapleader
	                    wasn't set by user explicitly
			  * ANX command/map (an AsNeeded find coupled with
			    execution)
	v2 Apr 05, 2004 : * bugfix: an error message showed up when the
	                    ../.vim/AsNeeded directory was empty of *.vim
			    files
			  * improved warning message when no matching
			    command/function/map is found
	v1 Feb 19, 2004 : AsNeeded first released
