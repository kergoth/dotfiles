2. AsNeeded Manual				*asneeded*

	The AsNeeded plugin transforms plugin use to either automatically
	loading or assisting in loading plugins when they're needed. >

		:AN command     :ANX command
		:AN map         :ANX map
<
	or >

		:AsNeeded command
		:AsNeeded map
<
	Functions are automatically loaded when called using the FuncUndefined
	event that Vim provides.  :AN or :AsNeeded assists with loading
	commands or maps by searching through plugin files placed in >

		.vim/AsNeeded/       (Unix)
		vimfiles\AsNeeded\   (Windows)
<
	for one containing the desired map or command; once found, AsNeeded
	then loads it.

	The ANX command follows successful searches with an attempt to execute
	the requested command or map.

	For those who have large numbers of scripts in their AsNeeded directory,
	using >
		:MakeANtags
<
	will create a ANtags file in the AsNeeded directory.  This file will then
	be used to quickly look up the requested map, command, or function; the
	usual search of all scripts in the directory will then be bypassed.

==============================================================================
3. AsNeeded Global Variables				*asneeded-var*

   	g:AsNeededSuccess : if this variable exists, then AsNeeded
	                    will inform the user of successful loading
			    of AsNeeded functions/commands/mappings.
