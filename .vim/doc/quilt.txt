===============================================================================
1. Quilt Introduction					           *quilt-intro*

Quilt is a project initiated by Andrew Morton to work with patches sent on the
LKML. It is quite stable now, and really useful to deal with stacked patches.

First of all, before using this plug-in, you must install quilt on your
station, for, under debian distribution, type in a command shell:
>
	 aptitude install quilt
<
Now that you have your station setup, let's speak a little about Quilt
itself, more information can be found in man quilt shell command.

The idea behind quilt is that you work on patches, not on sources directly, so
all your productions are patches. You create a patch to track your
modifications and send this patch to a work group so they can validate/accept
or integrate your modifications.

Now you need a tool to help you maintain your patches, and that's exactly
what quilt does. Quilt let you apply a patch, modify your files (and thus the
patch), unapply the patch. But it also allows you to do that on several
patches at a time (one patch applied after the other ...) that's what we call
the stacked patches. (or the patch stack). 

You can go to a level on the patch stack, modify the patch, and come back to
another patch stack level.

This plug-in helps you handle all those boring operations with simple Vim
commands ;)

To sum up the work-flow :

 First: 

|:QuiltSetup| <patchdir>

 Then:

|:QuiltNew|   <patchname>

 ... Open a file ... ~

|:QuiltAdd|

 ... Work on the file ... ~
 ... Save your modifiations ... ~

 |:QuiltRefresh|

 And so on ... 

Then you can go back to a previous patch using |:QuiltPop| or go further in
the patch stack |:QuiltPush| (see |quilt-patch-stack|)

And when you've finished to work with your patches, you can mail them for
instance |:QuiltHeader| |:QuiltMail| (see |quilt-advanced|)

At last quilt makes your patcher life easier :)

===============================================================================
2. Setting up the working directory			           *:QuiltSetup*

quilt needs to store its patches in a 'patches' directory. Moreover, quilt
stores the order in which all patches must be applied/unapplied in a files
called 'series'. (which can be located in the current directory, in the
'patches' directory, or in the '.pc' special directory).

|:QuiltSetup[!]| <patchdir>

Automatically creates all necessary links to make quilt work fine:

	* First, it checks if <patchdir> already exists and fail if not
	  to create the directory <patchdir>, |:QuiltSetup!| <patchdir>

	* Create a soft link to <patchdir> called 'patches' in the current
	  directory. (This only works under Linux for now ...)

	* Attempt to find the 'series' file, and if not found, creates an
	  empty 'series' file, in the 'patches' directory

Here you go!

<patchdir> is automatically completed, use [tab] to navigate in existing
directories. 

===============================================================================
3. Creating a new patch					             *:QuiltNew*

|:QuiltNew[!]| <patch>           

Creates a new patch on the top of the patch stack and apply it. Patches can be 
organized in directories. All patches are stored in the 'patches' directory
(or one of its sub-directory). 

To create a patch 'mypatch' in a directory 'mydir' use the command :

>
 :QuiltNew mydir/mypatch
<
If 'mydir' does not exist, QuitlNew will fail. Use '!' to create the directory
if this directory does not exist.

|:QuiltNew| fail in case the patch already exists.

===============================================================================
4. Adding a file to a patch				             *:QuiltAdd*

|:QuiltAdd| [file] [patch]    

Adds [file] to the current patch. If [file] is not specified, the current file
is added to the patch. The file must be added before any modification. Only
modifications done after |:QuiltAdd|will be added to the patch on next call to
|:QuiltRefresh:|

If [patch] is not mentioned, [file] is added to the topmost (current) patch.

 [file] is auto-completed, use [tab] to navigate through existing files.
 [patch] is also auto-completed, use [tab] to navigate through patches.

===============================================================================
5. Refreshing a patch					         *:QuiltRefresh*

|:QuiltRefresh| [patch]

Refreshes the patch [patch]. If [patch] is not specified, the current patch is
refreshed. 

|:QuiltRefresh| opens a quick-fix containing all quilt warnings
(currently only tested with 'trailing whitespace' warnings ... )

 [patch] is auto-completed, use [tab] to navigate through existing patches

===============================================================================
6. Deleting a patch					          *:QuiltDelete*

|:QuiltDelete[!]| [patch]     

Deletes the patch, default is delete the current patch. If '!' is used, the
patch file is also deleted.

 [patch] is auto-completed, use [tab] to navigate through existing patches

===============================================================================
7. Renaming a patch					          *:QuiltRename*

|:QuiltRename| [patch] <newname>

Rename [patch] to <newname>. If [patch] is not mentionned, rename the current
patch.

===============================================================================
8. Removing a file from a patch				          *:QuiltRemove*

|:QuiltRemove|     [file]     

Removes the file from the current patch. If [file] is not specified, removes
the current file from the patch.

 [file] is auto-completed, use <TAB> to navigate through files present in the
 current patch.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
							    *:QuiltRemoveFrom*
|:QuiltRemoveFrom| <patch> [file]

Removes [file] from <patch> (Same as|:QuiltRemove|)

 <patch> is auto-completed, use <TAB> to navigate through patches.
 [file] is auto-completed, use <TAB> to navigate though files in the <patch>

===============================================================================
9. Working with the Patch Stack				     *quilt-patch-stack*

One on the most interesting features of quilt is its ability to apply/unapply
a set of patch. Patches are applied one after the other, like a stack (the
most recent applied patch is said to be on the top of the stack).

This plug-in allow you to push/pop or directly go to a patch:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
								    *:QuiltPush*
|:QuiltPush[!]| [patch]
|:QuiltPush[!]| [number]

Pushes patch until [patch] is applied (or [number] of patches are applied). If
none of [patch] nor [number] is supplied, only push one patch (the next patch).

If the patch fail to apply, use '!' to force it, then refresh the patch using
the quilt command output.

When forcing a patch having FAILED hunks, the quickfix will contain a list
of rejected files. This list can be obtained with |:QuiltFiles|

 [patch] is auto-completed, use [tab] to navigate through unapplied patches


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
								 *:QuiltPushAll*

|:QuiltPushAll[!]|

Additionally the |:QuiltPushAll[!]| command pushes to the last patch of the
series. If the '!' is mentioned, the command will be forced (ie using the '-f'
switch of quilt).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
								     *:QuiltPop*
|:QuiltPop[!]| [patch]
|:QuiltPop[!]| [number]

Pops patch until [patch] is unapplied (or [number] of patches are unapplied). 
If none of [patch] nor [number] is supplied, only pop one patch off the stack.
(the current patch)

If the patch fail to unapply, use '!' to force it. It's usually a better idea to 
refresh (|:QuiltRefresh| a patch failing to unapply before trying again).

When forcing a patch having FAILED hunks, the quickfix will contain a list
of rejected files. This list can be obtained with |:QuiltFiles|

 [patch] is auto-completed, use [tab] to navigate through applied patches

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
								  *:QuiltPopAll*
|:QuiltPopAll[!]|

Additionally the |:QuiltPopAll[!]| command pops all patches of the series. If
the '!' is mentioned, the command is forced (ie using the '-f' switch of quilt)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
								    *:QuiltGoTo*
|:QuiltGoTo[!]|[patch]  

Push or pop to the specified patch (depending if the patch is applied or not)

 [patch] is auto-completed, use [tab] to navigate through existing patches

===============================================================================
10. Moving a modification from a patch to another	            *quilt-move*

***Warning This feature is not stable in the 0.5 version. Use it with care.***

								  *:QuiltMoveTo*
|:[range]QuiltMoveTo[!]| <patch>

Moves the text range from the current to <patch>. This command first creates a
patch to apply the modifications, deletes the range from the file, write it,
refresh the current patch, go to <patch>, and use the command |:diffpatch| to
add the range again. 

Once you've reviewed the modification (in the %-new split), stay in this
buffer and use |:QuiltFinishMove| to finish the operation.

If '!' is supplied, directly call |:QuiltFinishMove|

 [patch] is auto-completed, use [tab] to navigate through existing patches

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
							      *:QuiltFinishMove*
|:QuiltFinishMove[!]|

Finishes a move initiated with |:QuiltMoveTo| This command must be issued on
the %-new buffer to work, or strange results may occur.

===============================================================================
11. More about :Quilt* commands				        *quilt-advanced*

								  *:QuiltStatus*

|:QuiltStatus|

Shows/refresh the current patch name in the status bar, and add a flag
indicating if the current file is included ([+in]) in the current patch, or
not ([!in])

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
								   *:QuiltFiles*
|:QuiltFiles| [patch] 

Create a file list (in a quick-fix) for the given patch (default current), 
allowing to quickly review all files contained in a patch.

Files having a .rej file are marked as "error"

 [patch] is auto-completed, use [tab] to navigate through existing patches

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
								 *:QuiltPatches*

|:QuiltPatches| [file]

List all patches modifying [file]. (for now, patches are only echoed to the
output, a future version will add more power to this feature ... 

 [file] is auto-completed, use [tab] to navigate through existing files

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
								    *:QuiltMail*
|:QuiltMail| <destaddr> [patch1 [patch2]]

Open a thunderbird (you must have the 'thunderbird' command in your path) for 
each patch from [patch1] to [patch2]. All patches are sent using headers
contained in the patch as mail body (the special line Subject: ... is used to
build a subject line). If no subject is found, the content of the variable
|g:QuiltSubject| is used. See |g:QuiltSubject| for pattern replacement in the
subject.

Patches are added as attachment to the mail window, you'll just have to edit
the mail body (if needed) and click on the Send button.

If [patch2] is not specified, only send [patch1]

Since thunderbird needs some time to open a window, you may have to tune the 
|g:QuiltMailSleep| (default is 1)

The text of the message is directly taken out of the header, see |:QuiltHeader|
for more information about setting the header.

<destaddr> is searched in the|g:QuiltMailAddresses|list, use <TAB> to
naviguate in the email list.

[patch1]/|patch2] are searched into the patch list, use <TAB> to navigate in
the existing patch list.

The command used to start thunderbird is taken from |g:QuiltThunderbirdCmd| by
default it is set to "thunderbird" but you can change it (for instance on
debian, it should be set to "icedove")

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
							  *g:QuiltMailAddresses*

|g:QuiltMailAddresses|sets the list of automatically complted emails for
|:QuiltMail|command default is :
>
	let g:QuiltMailAddresses = [ 'test@localhost.com' ]
<

you can add more into your .vimrc :
>
	let g:QuiltMailAddresses = [ 'test@localhost.com'
	                         \ , 'someotherplace@here.com
	                         \ , ... ]
<
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
							      *g:QuiltMailSleep*

|g:QuiltMailSleep|

This variable defines the time interval to wait before opening two Mail
compose window using thunderbird. Default is 1
>
	let g:QuiltMailSleep = 2
<
sets it to two seconds ...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
						         *g:QuiltThunderbirdCmd*
|g:QuiltThunderbirdCmd|

This variable contains the command line used to start thunderbird, it is
"thunderbird" by default. On some system, (debian etch and sid) thunderbird is
renamed to "icedove" so you should set it in your .vimrc :

>
	let g:QuiltThunderbirdCmd = "icedove"
<

The command used to start thunderbird is taken from |g:QuiltThunderbirdCmd| by
default it is set to "thunderbird" but you can change it (for instance on
debian, it should be set to "icedove")

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
								   *g:QuiltLang*
|g:QuiltLang|

The lang of the spell checking for patches headers (default en_US)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
								*g:QuiltSubject*
|g:QuiltSubject|

This variable is used in case no other subject can be taken out of a patch
header, when using |:QuiltMail| command. The default is:

>
	let g:QuiltSubject = '[patch @num@/@total@] @name@'
<

In the subject line (coming from this variable, or coming from a patch header),

    @num@ is replaced by the number in the patch serie (the serie is only the
	  list of sent patches, not the whole serie)

    @total@ the total number of patches sent in this command

    @name@ is replaced by the filename of the patch

(remember |:QuiltMail| creates one message per patch, so only @total@ is a 
constant, other are different on each mail)

This variable is also used for the creation of empty headers (see |:QuiltHeader|


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
								  *:QuiltHeader*
|:QuiltHeader| [patch]

This command opens a header tab for the given [patch] (if [patch] is not 
supplied the current topmost patch is used)

In case the header is empty, the header is initialized with the |g:QuiltSubject|
variable content. Moreover, this commands set 'spell', and 'spelllang' to 
|g:QuiltLang|

To write the header, you must then call |:QuiltWriteHeader|

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
							     *:QuiltWriteHeader*
|:QuiltWriteHeader|

This command writes the header to the patch (formerly set by |:QuiltHeader|)
This command can only be used in a tab opened by|:QuiltHeader|

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
							       *:QuiltPatchEdit*
|:QuiltPatchEdit| [patch]

Open a tab editing the given [patch] if [patch] is ommited, the current patch
is opened.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
							        *:QuiltAnnotate*
|:QuiltAnnotate[!]| [file]

Opens an interface showing which patch modifies which line of [file] or the 
current file if [file] is ommited. If [file] is specified, it is opened in the
current buffer (force with '!' if you want to open it even if modified).
The interface looks like the following :

+--+--------------------------------+
|n |                                |
|  |                                |
|  |                                |
|  |                                |
+--+--------------------------------+
+ n patchName                       +
+ m patchName                       +
+-----------------------------------+

The left split shows a number, which references the number on the bottom split.
In the bottom split, the number is translated into corresponding patch name.

(This information is only relevant if the patch is refreshed with all changes
and thus, is not anymore when the file gets modified).

The current line is highlighted for better readability, and the current patch
(corresponding to the current line) is highlighted too. The drawback is that
the refresh is a little slow ... 

The interface is closed when either the number or patch buffer is closed.

						     *g:QuiltAnnotateFollowLine*

You can disable the follow cursor by setting the |g:QuiltAnnotateFollowLine|
variable to 0 :
>
	:let g:QuiltAnnotateFollowLine = 0
>
