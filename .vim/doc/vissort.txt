2. Bisort : binary search sort					*bisort*

   :[range]Bisort

   Applies an in-place binary-search sort.  Generally its faster than
   quicksort with Vim since its using Vim's interpreter.

   EXAMPLES

	Original Text:
	one      two      three   four
	five     six      seven   eight
	nine     ten      eleven  twelve
	thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen

	Use Visual-Line (V) mode to select text, then Bisort - sorts lines:
		V to select lines
		:Bisort
	five     six      seven   eight
	nine     ten      eleven  twelve
	one      two      three   four
	thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen

	Use <vis.vim>'s B command with Bissort - sorts the column only:
	    ctrl-v to select column
	    :'<,'>B Bisort
	one      fourteen three   four
	five     six      seven   eight
	nine     ten      eleven  twelve
	thirteen two      fifteen sixteen

3. Vissort     							*vissort*
>
	sorting lines based on selected column
<
   :[range]Vissort   actually same as Bisort
   :'<,'>Vissort     apply sort to visual-block only

   Select a block of text with visual-block mode; use the Vissort command to
   sort the block.  This function sorts the lines *based on the selected
   column*.

   EXAMPLE

	Original Text:
	one      two      three   four
	five     six      seven   eight
	nine     ten      eleven  twelve
	thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen

	Use ctrl-v (Visual-Block) to select two..fourteen column,
	then Vissort:
	thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen
	five     six      seven   eight
	nine     ten      eleven  twelve
	one      two      three   four

4. Sorting A Column Only				*vissort-column*
>
	sorting a column independently of the surrounding lines
<
   |vissort| provides the ability to sort lines based on a column; the
   technique described here allows one to sort columns independently of any
   line contents surrounding the column.

   To accomplish this you'll also need the <vis.vim> script; you may acquire
   a copy at:
>
	http://mysite.verizon.net/astronaut/vim/index.html#VimFuncs
	as "Visual Block Commands"
<
   This topic is also covered by the tip:
>
   http://vim.sourceforge.net/tips/tip.php?tip_id=588
<
   Select the column using |blockwise-visual| mode (use ctrl-v, move).  Then,
   assuming <vis.vim> has been installed as a plugin, type
>
	:B Bisort
<
   or you may often use an external sorting program; in such a case, the
   typical command is:
>
	:B !sort
<
  Since these methods use blockwise-visual selection, the command will appear
  as
>
	:'<,'>B Bisort


==============================================================================
5. BlockSort   							*blocksort*

   :'<,'>BS
   :'< '>BS nextblock endblock findtag tagpat tagsub
   :[range]call BlockSort(nextblock,endblock,findtag,tagpat,tagsub)
   :[range]call BlockSort(...)

              If any arguments are missing, BlockSort()
                    will query the user for them.

    This function's purpose is to sort blocks of text based on tags
    contained within the blocks.

    WARNING: this function can move lots of text around, so using it
    is use-at-your-own-risk!  Please check and verify that things
    have worked as you expected.  Backing up your file before
    modifying it would be advisable before doing such things as
    sorting C functions.

    nextblock:
      Blocks are assumed to begin on a line containing the nextblock pattern.

      If the nextblock pattern is "" (the empty string), then the next block is
      assumed to begin with the line following the line matching the endblock
      pattern.

    endblock:
      Blocks are assumed to end with a line containing the endblock pattern.

      If the endblock pattern is "" (the empty string), then the end of the
      block will be assumed to be the line preceding the line matching
      the nextblock pattern.

    findtag:
      Blocks are assumed to contain a tag findable by the findtag pattern.

      If the findtag pattern is "", then nextblock line will be assumed
      to contain the tag.

    tagpat, tagsub:
      The tagpat and tagsub are used by a |substitute()|; the tag is extracted
      by applying the tagpat to the line containing the tag and substitution
      is made with the tagsub pattern.

      If the tagpat is "", then it will default to '^.*$'.

      If the tagsub is "", then if the tagpat was "", then tagsub will
      take on the default value of "&".

      If the tagsub is "" but the tagpat wasn't "", then the tagsub will
      take on the default value of '\1'.

   EXAMPLES

    1. :[range]call BlockSort('^[a-z]','---$','\u','^.*\(\u\).*$','\1')

     Original Text: >
     	one
             	some
             	junk
             	B
             	appears
             	---
     	two
             	some more
             	junk
             	A
             	appears here.
             	---
<
     After BlockSort('^[a-z]','---$','\u','^.*\(\u\).*$','\1') >
     	two
             	some more
             	junk
             	A
             	appears here.
             	---
     	one
             	some
             	junk
             	B
             	appears
             	---

    2. Sorting C functions (see warning above!)  [USE AT YOUR OWN RISK]

	:[range]CFuncSort
	:[range]call BlockSort('','^}','^[^/*]\&^[^ ][^*]\&^.*\h\w*\s*(','^.\{-}\(\h\w*\)\s*(.*$','')

	CFuncSort is a command that does exactly the same thing as the
	BlockSort shown above; its just easier to type.

	Each function is a block; the nextblock is implied by being the endblock + 1.

	The endblock assumes that C functions end with a pattern matching '^}'.  This
	assumption is not required by the language, but it is typical use.

	The findtag pattern attempts to avoid comments; its not perfect:
	                 1         2
	        12345678901234567890  <--column
		/* something()
		 * somethingelse()
		 */
       		// something()
	Its looking for a C-word ('\h\w*') followed by possible white space
	and an open parenthesis.  It undoubtedly can be confused by prototypes,
	stuff that looks like functions but is inside comments, etc.

	Once such a line is found, the tagpat operates to identify the function name.
	Since tagsub is '', its default value of '\1' is used.
