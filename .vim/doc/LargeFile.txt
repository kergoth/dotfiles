1. Large File Plugin						*largefile*

The LargeFile plugin is fairly short -- it simply sets up an |autocmd| that
checks for large files.  There is one parameter: >
	g:LargeFile
which, by default, is 100.  Thus 100MByte files and larger are considered to
be "large files"; smaller ones aren't.  Of course, you as a user may set
g:LargeFile to whatever you want in your <.vimrc> (in units of MBytes).

Basically, this autocmd simply turns off a number of features in Vim,
including event handling, undo, and syntax highlighting, in the interest of
speed and responsiveness.

LargeFile.vim borrows from vimtip#611.
