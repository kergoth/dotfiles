The userChrome.js extension allows to easily customize Firefox through JavaScript.

Get the extension here:

Simply edit the file userChrome.js (in the same place as userChrome.css) and its 
content will be run whenever a new browser window is opened (onLoad). 

This release should work for Firefox and Thunderbird 1.0 and newer, Mozilla Suite, 
SeaMonkey, Netscape and Netscape Browser, Nvu, Sunbird and Flock - about just as 
long as extensions can be installed.
