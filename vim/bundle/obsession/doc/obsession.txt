USAGE                                           *obsession* *:Obsession*

:Obsession {file}       Invoke |:mksession| on {file} and continue to keep it
                        updated until Vim exits, triggering on the |BufEnter|
                        and |VimLeavePre| autocommands.  If the file exists,
                        it will be overwritten if and only if it looks like a
                        session file.

:Obsession {dir}        Invoke |:Obsession| on {dir}/Session.vim.  Use "." to
                        write to a session file in the current directory.

:Obsession              If session tracking is already in progress, pause it.
                        Otherwise, resume tracking or create a new session in
                        the current directory.

:Obsession!             Stop obsession and delete the underlying session file.

Loading a session created with |:Obsession| automatically resumes updates to
that file.

STATUS INDICATOR                                *obsession-status*

                                                *ObsessionStatus()*
Add %{ObsessionStatus('[%s]')} to 'statusline', 'tabline', or 'titlestring' to
get an indicator when Obsession is active or paused.  For more advanced uses,
ObsessionStatus() with no arguments returns 0, 1, and 2 for inactive, paused,
and active, respectively.
