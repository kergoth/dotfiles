The best contribution is one that deletes code.  Find a better home for these!
It would be wonderful, for example, if [vim-go][] could be persuaded to set
`'path'`, freeing Apathy of the obligation.  Similarly if you want to add
support for a new language, see if there's another plugin that might be a
better fit for it first.  But I created this plugin because I know that's not
always possible.  Contributions for both additional and already supported file
types are welcome.
