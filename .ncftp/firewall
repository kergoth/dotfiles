# NcFTP firewall preferences
# ==========================
#
# If you need to use a proxy for FTP, you can configure it below.
# If you do not need one, leave the ``firewall-type'' variable set
# to 0.  Any line that does not begin with the ``#'' character is
# considered a configuration command line.
#
# NOTE:  NcFTP does NOT support HTTP proxies that do FTP, such as "squid"
#        or Netscape Proxy Server.  Why?  Because you have to communicate with
#        them using HTTP, and this is a FTP only program.
#
# Types of firewalls:
# ------------------
#
#    type 1:  Connect to firewall host, but send "USER user@real.host.name"
#
#    type 2:  Connect to firewall, login with "USER fwuser" and
#             "PASS fwpassword", and then "USER user@real.host.name"
#
#    type 3:  Connect to and login to firewall, and then use
#             "SITE real.host.name", followed by the regular USER and PASS.
#
#    type 4:  Connect to and login to firewall, and then use
#             "OPEN real.host.name", followed by the regular USER and PASS.
#
#    type 5:  Connect to firewall host, but send
#             "USER user@fwuser@real.host.name" and
#             "PASS pass@fwpass" to login.
#
#    type 6:  Connect to firewall host, but send
#             "USER fwuser@real.host.name" and
#             "PASS fwpass" followed by a regular
#             "USER user" and
#             "PASS pass" to complete the login.
#
#    type 7:  Connect to firewall host, but send
#             "USER user@real.host.name fwuser" and
#             "PASS pass" followed by
#             "ACCT fwpass" to complete the login.
#
#    type 8:  Connect to firewall host, but send "USER user@real.host.name:port"
#
#    type 9:  Connect to firewall host, but send "USER user@real.host.name port"
#
#    type 0:  Do NOT use a firewall (most users will choose this).
#
firewall-type=0
#
#
#
# The ``firewall-host'' variable should be the IP address or hostname of
# your firewall server machine.
#
firewall-host=firewall.localdomain
#
#
#
# The ``firewall-user'' variable tells NcFTP what to use as the user ID
# when it logs in to the firewall before connecting to the outside world.
#
firewall-user=kergoth
#
#
#
# The ``firewall-password'' variable is the password associated with
# the firewall-user ID.  If you set this here, be sure to change the
# permissions on this file so that no one (except the superuser) can
# see your password.  You may also leave this commented out, and then
# NcFTP will prompt you each time for the password.
#
firewall-password=fwpass
#
#
#
# Your firewall may require you to connect to a non-standard port for
# outside FTP services, instead of the internet standard port number (21).
#
firewall-port=21
#
#
#
# You probably do not want to FTP to the firewall for hosts on your own
# domain.  You can set ``firewall-exception-list'' to a list of domains
# or hosts where the firewall should not be used.  For example, if your
# domain was ``probe.net'' you could set this to ``.probe.net''.
#
# If you leave this commented out, the default behavior is to attempt to
# lookup the current domain, and exclude hosts for it.  Otherwise, set it
# to a list of comma-delimited domains or hostnames.  The special token
# ``localdomain'' is used for unqualified hostnames, so if you want hosts
# without explicit domain names to avoid the firewall, be sure to include
# that in your list.
#
firewall-exception-list=.localdomain,localhost,localdomain
#
#
#
# You may also specify passive mode here.  Normally this is set in the
# regular $HOME/.ncftp/prefs file.  This must be set to one of
# "on", "off", or "optional", which mean always use PASV,
# always use PORT, and try PASV then PORT, respectively.
#
#passive=on
#

# NOTE:  This file was created for you on Wed Oct 26 15:11:09 2005
#        by NcFTP 3.1.9.  Removing this file will cause the next run of NcFTP
#        to generate a new one, possibly with more configurable options.
#
# ALSO:  A /etc/ncftp.firewall file, if present, is processed before this file,
#        and a /etc/ncftp.firewall.fixed file, if present, is processed after.
