Personally, I'd have a far better time writing scripts if I had some more
creative shells to script in...

ASMsh: The Assembly shell. Commands include MOV, SHL, SHR, JNE, etc.

shellTM: Turing machine shell. Only four commands. Read, write, move left,
move right. Capable of producing any programming language imaginable, given
enough time and nerves of steel.

GeneSH: Four commands. G, A, T, C. Need I say more?

Qsh: Only uses one environment variable, which contains all possible values
simultaneously. Method of scripting: isolate the universe in which the
desired result is already accomplished, and intersect with it.

Of course, I never said they'd be easy to use. But then, if these shells
existed, and I knew a sysadmin who used any of them, you can believe
Sysadmin Day would be a far more celebrated holiday.

The dictionary definition of capitalism is: An economic system characterized
by private ownership of capital goods and by investments that are determined
by private decision rather than by state control. Prices, production and
distribution of goods are determined by a free market. 

...

But most writers and commentators put dishonest altruistic-platonistic
connotations on the meaning of capitalism: A system of exploitation of the
weak by the strong -- devoid of love and good will. A system in which
unwanted goods and services are pushed onto consumers through clever,
deceptive advertising for the sole purpose of profits and greed. Capitalism
dominates most Western governments. Capitalism, big business, and fascism
are synonymous.

Yet, acting on fully integrated honesty (Neo-Tech), not reason itself, is
the basic moral act. When Genghis Khan, for example, chose to use reasoning
for a specific military move, then in an out-of-context sense, he chose to
act morally by protecting himself and his troops (thus filling human
biological needs). But in the larger sense of fully integrated honesty,
Khan's total actions were grossly immoral in choosing to use aggressive
force in becoming a mass murderer (thus negating human biological needs).
The highly destructive, irrational immorality of Genghis Khan's overall
dictatorial military actions far outweighed any narrow, out-of-context
"moral" actions. ...Genghis Khan was enormously evil as were Stalin, Hitler,
Mao, Castro, Pol Pot.

Why are there so many unmaintainable applications written in PHP and Perl?
Because PHP and Perl let undisciplined, inexperienced programmers write
useful code. So does Ruby -- but give it the popularity and longevity of PHP
and Perl (at least in English-speaking circles) and I bet you'll see plenty
of bad code written in Ruby too.

This seems like a variant of the Hackers and Painters fallacy. (Paul Graham
is rich. Paul Graham writes Lisp. Therefore everyone who writes Lisp will
get rich.) "All of the good, smart programmers I know are using Ruby. They
write good code. Therefore you can't write bad code in Ruby!"

It feels like there's another fallacy in there somewhere. I want to call it
the Pre-Post-Java Blindspot, where Java was the beginning of Serious
Programming Languages and only its successor will unseat it. (Like any good
fallacy, you have to ignore history, such as the fact that Ruby's between 10
and 12 years old.)

(I mean, if you really just can't read regular expressions, why not admit
it? You could start a twelve-step program or something.)

Much of the relative simplicity of Java is - like for most new languages -
partly an illusion and partly a function of its incompleteness. As time
passes, Java will grow significantly in size and complexity. It will double
or triple in size and grow implementation-dependent extensions or libraries.
That is the way every commercially successful language has developed. Just
look at any language you consider successful on a large scale. I know of no
exceptions, and there are good reasons for this phenomenon. [I wrote this
before 2000; now see a preview of Java 1.5 - http://xrl.us/kb3a ]

Although the contents of her book, The Virtue of Selfishness, are precisely
accurate and widely integrated, Ayn Rand committed an error by distorting the
word "selfishness" in fashioning a dramatic statement. The word "selfishness"
does have valuable, precise denotations of "an irrational, harmful disregard
for others". Rand could have strengthened her work by selecting accurate
wording such as rational self-growth. Instead, she unnecessarily bent and
undermined the precise, valuable meaning of selfishness. ...As with
selflessness, selfishness is a form of immature, destructive, irrational
behavior -- a form of stupid behavior.

khatul's comment:

Without a glitch, huh? Apparently you (and Uri) managed to install Linux from a
Windows XP installation CD. This is much more than telekinesis. It smells like
pure alien intervention. Report immediately!

It's one of those rare "perfect" kernels. So if it doesn't 
happen to compile with your config (or it does compile, but then does 
unspeakable acts of perversion with your pet dachshund), you can rest easy 
knowing that it's all your own d*mn fault, and you should just fix your 
evil ways.

You could send me and the kernel mailing list a note about it anyway, of 
course. (And perhaps pictures, if your dachshund is involved. Not that 
we'd be interested, of course. No. Just so that we'd know to avoid it next 
time).

 <castoff>  merlyn: is it true that array itteration is better
            performance wise than hash itteration?
         *  avar would guess that array iter is faster than hash iter
  <merlyn>  what is "hash iter"?
  <merlyn>  with "each()"?
 <castoff>  foreach key...
    <avar>  yeah, or keys
  <merlyn>  I don't see those as comparable
  <merlyn>  when you have a hash, and you need to iterate, you do.
  <merlyn>  when you have an array, and you need to iterate, you do
  <merlyn>  what is there to choose between?
 <castoff>  the hash has no real value stored other than the key so i
            converted to arrays
    <avar>  merlyn: you can compare the speed of the two operations
    <avar>  well duh
  <merlyn>  Why would you compare the speed of unrelated events?

            performance comparison article! :)
  <merlyn>  "always optimize for baking bread!"

    <ides>  merlyn: I was thinking more along the lines of "Performance
            comparison on Perl vs RoR vs Ice Fishing"
  <merlyn>  "I repeated baking bread 5000 times to get the average"
  <merlyn>  "It took me six years"

       <merlyn>  it fails because of its parents!
       <merlyn>  I blame its parents
       <merlyn>  It fails because of society.
       <merlyn>  it fails as a fundamental shortcoming of Perl

In a widely anticipated move, Linux "headcase" Torvalds today announced
the immediate availability of the most advanced Linux kernel to date,
version 2.6.20.

Before downloading the actual new kernel, most avid kernel hackers have
been involved in a 2-hour pre-kernel-compilation count-down, with some
even spending the preceding week doing typing exercises and reciting PI
to a thousand decimal places.

The half-time entertainment is provided by randomly inserted trivial
syntax errors that nerds are expected to fix at home before completing
the compile, but most people actually seem to mostly enjoy watching the
compile warnings, sponsored by Anheuser-Busch, scroll past. 

As ICD head analyst Walter Dickweed put it: "Releasing a new kernel on
Superbowl Sunday means that the important 'pasty white nerd'
constituency finally has something to do while the rest of the country
sits comatose in front of their 65" plasma screens". 

Walter was immediately attacked for his racist and insensitive remarks
by Geeks without Borders representative Marilyn vos Savant, who pointed
out that not all of their members are either pasty nor white.  "Some of
them even shower!" she added, claiming that the constant stereotyping
hurts nerds' standing in society. 

Geeks outside the US were just confused about the whole issue, and were
heard wondering what the big hoopla was all about. Some of the more
culturally aware of them were heard snickering about balls that weren't
even round.

Slashdot Comment on Reasons to or not to use MySQL:
---------------------------------------------------

    A nice flame war. I'm just going to sit back, crack a beer and enjoy it. 
    It is almost memorial day weekend, you know. Hopefully it get hot enough 
    in here to roast a hot dog.

Oh goody! I'll help get things going:

* MySQL users will have to wait until you are done with the fire before they
can roast their hot dogs, since MySQL is not a real database and does not 
support concurrent roasting; 

* I've read the PostgreSQL manual eight times and still can't figure out 
something as bloody simple as roasting a hot dog, though I did figure out I 
have to call VACUUM before I can apply ketchup; 

* Serious enterprises who care about their hot dogs use Oracle, since you can
roast over 10,000 dogs at once and optionally impart the taste of filet mignon; 

* If you try to roast a footlong hotdog using MySQL it will silently truncate 
it to regular size, causing your child to cry;

* Oracle will sue you if you complain about the difficulty of starting your
* fire or the blackened taste of the dogs; 

* With SQLite your hot dogs are pre-roasted; 

* Last year on Memorial Day, mysqld leapt out of my MacBook Pro and pushed my
cousin into the fire, resulting in third degree burns. And also it causes
cancer. And terrorism. Blindness. Violent puppy death. BOO! MYSQL IS SCARY
DON'T USE MYSQL!!
