A Jewish Deduction

The Bible dictates that "Thou shalt not seethe [= cook] a kid [= young goat]
in his mother's milk." To avoid any possibility of breaking that regulation, 
the Jewish tradition ruled that it also applies to female goats, to mature
goats, and to the meat and milk of two completely unrelated goats. It is 
also forbidden to eat the meat with fresh milk, and it applies to beef 
and mutten as well (including mixing the milk and meat of two different
beasts). Finally, chicken, which are incapable of milk production, may not
be eaten along with any mammal's milk either. 

We are fortunate that most mathematicians were not Jewish. Otherwise, it
would have been forbidden to divide by all numbers between -1 and 1.

Suggested Improvements to the Documentation:

The WYSIWYT project was for a long time fascinated by Microsoft's tremendous 
desire to advance its Internet Explorer web-browser. We saw the fact that 
they switched the help systems of the upcoming Windows 98, as well as 
Microsoft Visual C++ 5.0, to HTML a major step in advancing our project.

As a complementary step, some of the chief heads of our project suggested
that the Windows' manuals themselves, as well as all of Microsoft's ads,
will be designed in HTML and printed after being rendered by IE4. While this
project is in the preliminary and planning stages, we expect it to acquire a
large momentum soon.

2. Richard M. Stallman - a hippy. How girly is that? 
3. Eric S. Raymond - a nice looking man with a mustache. Baby faced, so he

4. Larry Wall - a cross between Linus and RMS (i.e: a hippy dweeb) that is 
even more girly.

Are you kidding?

CVS is not advanced as:

1. Microsoft Visual SourceSafe - the only sane choice for good data integrity 
and portability.

2. tarballs/zip-files and patches. This one excels in convenience, and 
robustness.

CVS is a very advanced version control system, however. I do wish that 
Subversion (which is a VCS that I have to use against my will) was as good as 
it is.

Hi Omer! Mazal Tov on Chen and yours marriage. It reminds me of a quote from 
Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre:

"At this period she married, removed with her husband (a clergyman, an 
excellent man, *almost worthy of such a wife*) to a distant county, and 
consequently was lost to me."

Well, in your case I can say that both of you are almost worthy of each other. Congrats again!

It does not mean what I think it means, but it means what *you* think it
means.

  <rindolf>  Mahmoud: what's up?
  <Mahmoud>  rindolf, writing a CMS from scratch with perl.. really
             cool, making my own template engine
  <rindolf>  Mahmoud: why???
  <rindolf>  Mahmoud: use TT2.
  <rindolf>  Or whatever.
  <Mahmoud>  rindolf, i dislike other CMS engines.. they are bloated and
             i don't trust them
  <rindolf>  Mahmoud: TT2 is pure perl.
          *  Mahmoud looks for TT2
  <rindolf>  Mahmoud: a CMS doesn't stay simple forever.
  <rindolf>  Mahmoud: and a CMS != Templating system.
  <Mahmoud>  rindolf, the template engine is quite simple, it's similar
             to how SimpleMachines forum does its templates
  <Mahmoud>  rindolf, just an external file with print 'foo'; commands
 <amnesiac>  Mahmoud, TT2 is very powerful
 <amnesiac>  Mahmoud, there are more templating systems, why not use any
             ofo the existing ones?
  <rindolf>  Mahmoud: please don't re-invent square wheels.
  <Mahmoud>  heh..
  <NOTevil>  oval!
          *  amnesiac likes hexagonal wheels
  <NOTevil>  very small octagon wheels aren't too bad.
  <rindolf>  amnesiac: triangular wheels are the best!
   <Shaine>  i like star shaped wheels :/

  <ferret>  LeoNerd: That was one of the first blobs of Java I wrote,
            it's allowed to be even more verbose and convoluted than
            Java normally is. ;P
 <rindolf>  ferret: link?
  <ferret>  /las Cat.java
 <rindolf>  ferret: an implementation of the UNIX "cat" program in
            Java??
  <ferret>  Actually, specifically the GNU cat program, and only a
            subset thereof.
 <rindolf>  ferret: oh.
 <rindolf>  ferret: how many lines did it take?
         *  f00li5h heads off to #codegolf and tries to convince them to
            allow java submissions
  <ferret>  rindolf: It's mostly argument parser.
 <rindolf>  ferret: I once implemented a parser for a subset of the
            Bourne Shell args, in really hideous ANSI C.
 <rindolf>  f00li5h: good luck.
 <rindolf>  f00li5h: Java Golf...
 <f00li5h>  yeah, for sure!
 <rindolf>  Java Golf would be longer than a non-Golfed Perl program.
 <f00li5h>  rindolf: this is true
 <rindolf>  f00li5h: COBOL Golf!

 <strugglingintern>  there it goes...
          <rindolf>  strugglingintern: oh my god!
          <rindolf>  strugglingintern: this code looks really bad.
 <strugglingintern>  heh...
          <rindolf>  strugglingintern: if ($records eq 0 ) - don't you
                     want ($records == 0)?
          <rindolf>  strugglingintern: do you have unit tests?
          <rindolf>  strugglingintern: and you should factor it better.
          <rindolf>  strugglingintern: and possibly use Template Toolkit
                     or something.
          <rindolf>  strugglingintern: and you may have some
                     HTML-injection (or XSS) problems.
            <Ani-_>  rindolf: and probably SQL injection problems.
          <rindolf>  Ani-_: indeed!
 <strugglingintern>  :-/
            <Ani-_>  strugglingintern: really, ask them to review that
                     code when they get back.
 <strugglingintern>  alright
 <strugglingintern>  I appreciate it anyway
          <rindolf>  strugglingintern: how long have you been
                     programming perl?
 <strugglingintern>  hah, about 3 months
 <strugglingintern>  This isn't all my code ;)
 <strugglingintern>  I'll look into it
 <strugglingintern>  Thanks guys (and gals).
          <rindolf>  strugglingintern: you're welcome.
 <strugglingintern>  not my choice ;)
 <strugglingintern>  it's my 3rd week here :)
          <rindolf>  Amazing how much more experienced programmers can
                     tell a code is bad from a quick glance.
          <rindolf>  It's a bit scary.
            <Ani-_>  nothing amazing about it. It's called skill. :)
           <The_SB>  yeh even I can tell it by a look
            <ology>  It's not scary or amazing at all.
            <ology>  It is called experience!
            <Ani-_>  rindolf: what do you find scary?
            <Ani-_>  rindolf: that experienced programmers can tell it?
                     Or the code itself?
            <Ani-_>  I would disagree on the first one but agree on the
                     later! :)
          <rindolf>  Ani-_: no, that I'm so experienced.
          <rindolf>  Ani-_: I hope I don't sound out as a snob.
            <ology>  narcissism is fun
          <rindolf>  I should get a life.
          <rindolf>  Get a girlfriend, go to movies.
          <rindolf>  Instead all I do is write Perl.
          <rindolf>  And chat about writing Perl.

 <rindolf>  Let me wikipedia it.
 <f00li5h>  so now wikipedia is a verb?
 <rindolf>  f00li5h: it's gonna enter the OED.
 <rindolf>  f00li5h: in English every verb can be nounified and every
            noun can be verbed.
 <rindolf>  f00li5h: google is now a verb too.
 <f00li5h>  rindolf: q{ just one second and i'll "computer" it up for
            you"}
 <rindolf>  f00li5h: LOL.
 <rindolf>  f00li5h++
         *  rindolf f00li5hes jql
 <rindolf>  I'm rindolfed
         *  f00li5h finds it odd that irssi hilighted half of that word
 <rindolf>  f00li5h: it's much harder to do it in Hebrew.
     <jql>  computer is from the verb compute already
 <rindolf>  jql: there's computerise though.
 <f00li5h>  jql: but to computer something is different than computing
            it
 <f00li5h>  COMPUTIFY!
 <rindolf>  jql: I once thought that the study of Objectivity is
            Objectivism.
 <f00li5h>  "configurated"
     <jql>  you shouldn't noun up a verb that's been nouned already
 <rindolf>  And the study of Objectivism is Objectivistalism.
  <Caelum>  heh
 <rindolf>  And that study of that is Objectvisitalistalism.
 <rindolf>  And to infinity it's Objectivist-elementalism!

       <dkr>  I use nedit, the only app with a quadruple-click feature

 <Patterner>  quintuple-click selects the whole harddisk

       <arw>  rindolf: no matter, the universe is finite :)
       <arw>  rindolf: only problem is, the information about your
