me again he can call and if not, that's fine too. So after a looooot of 
talking. . . I convinced him.

Joey: Let me get this straight. He got you to beg to sleep with him, he got

Chandler: Yes, but this is Pete. Okay? He's not like other people, on your
first date he took you to Rome. For most guys that's like a third or
fourth date kinda thing.

Guru Saj: You must be Ross.

Ross: Hi.

Guru Saj: I am Guru Saj. (takes the drawer back and replaces)

Ross: Listen, I got to tell you I've-I've never been to a guru before, so...

Guru Saj: Well, relax. If it makes you feel better, I've attended some of
the finest medical schools in Central America.

Monica: Please tell me you're stopping now.

Pete: I'm fine! I'd fight tonight, if they'd let me. [stands up and starts
swinging his arms] See this circle I'm marking off here? This is my zone
of terror.

Monica: You are insane! You-you gotta give this up!

Pete: I can't until I'm the ultimate fighter. I will do it. I'm telling
you, the day will come when children will argue over who will win a
fight, me or Superman. Now, I'm not saying I could beat Superman, but
y'know, kids are stupid.

who knew my parents, and then my client with the fuzzy back gives me his
beach house.

Phoebe Sr.: So I guess you'd like to know how it all happened. 

Phoebe: I-I mean I, well I think I can figure it out. I guess y'know I was
born, and everyone
started lying their asses off!

Phoebe Sr.: Noo! No! It wasn't like that I... Remember how I told you how
Lily, Frank, and I we were, we were close. Well, we were, we were very close.

Phoebe: How close?

Phoebe Sr.: Well, the-the three of us we were, kind of umm, a couple.

Phoebe: I don't even know how that would work!

Phoebe Sr.: Well, we were...

Phoebe: (interrupting) I'm not asking!

Joey: All right. [gets up] 

Monica: [stopping him] No! Joey, we swore we'd never tell!

Chandler: [running over and joining Monica] They'll never understand!

Joey: Well, we have to say something! We have to get it out! It's eating me
alive!! Monica got stung by a jellyfish.

Monica: [interrupting] All right!! All right. [walks slowly into the living
room] I got stung. Stung bad. I couldn't stand. I-I couldn't walk.

Chandler: [following Monica] We were two miles from the house. Scared and
alone. We didn't think we could make it. [He goes to put his hands on Monica's 
shoulders but for some reason can quite complete the action and pulls back.]

Monica: I was in too much pain.

Joey: And I was tired from digging the huge hole!

Chandler: And then Joey remembered something.

Joey: I'd seen this thing on The Discovery Channel...

Ross: Wait a minute! I saw that! On The Discovery Channel, yeah! About
jellyfish and how if you... [stops suddenly and turns to look at Monica] 
Ewwww!! You peed on yourself?!

Phoebe and Rachel: Ewwww!!

Monica: You can't say that!! You-you don't know!! I mean I thought I was
gonna pass out from the pain! Anyway I-I tried, but I-I couldn't...bend that
way. So... [looks at Joey.]

Phoebe, Ross, and Rachel: [turning to look at Joey] Ewwww!!

Joey: That's right I stepped up! She's my friend and she needed help! And if
I had too, I'd pee on anyone of you! Only, uhh, I couldn't. I got the stage
fright. I wanted to help, but there was too much pressure. So-so I uh, I 
turned to Chandler.

Chandler: [wails loudly into his hands] Joey kept screaming at me: "Do it
now! Do it!! Do it! Do it now!!".
Sometimes late at night I can still here the screaming.

Joey: [laughs] That's cause sometimes I just do it through my wall to freak
you out.

Ross: I didn't know what I was taking full responsibility for! Okay?! I
didn't finish the whole letter!

Rachel: What?!!

Ross: I fell asleep!

Rachel: You fell asleep?!

Ross: It was 5:30 in the morning, and you had rambled on for 18 pages. Front
and back!! 
Oh-oh-oh, and by the way, Y-O-U-apostrophe-R-E means "you are," Y-O-U-R means 
"your!"

Rachel: Y'know I can't believe I even thought about getting back together
again! We are so over!!

Ross: [starts to cry] FINE BY ME!! [he opens the door and traps Chandler
behind it]

Rachel: Oh, oh, and hey-hey-hey, those little spelling tips will come in
handy when you're at home on Saturday nights playing Scrabble with Monica!!

Monica: Hey!!

Rachel: [to Monica] Sorry!! [to Ross] I just feel bad about all that sleep
you're gonna miss wishing you were with me!

Ross: Oh, no-no-no don't you worry about me falling asleep. I still have
your letter!!!

Rachel: And hey! Just so you know, it's not that common, it doesn't happen
to every guy, and it is a big deal!!

Chandler: I KNEW IT!!!
