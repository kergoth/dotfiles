#  - Consider separating the games within a given emulator where possible.
#    - DuckStation
#    - melonDS
#    - ScummVM
#    - RetroArch
#  - PCSX2 seems to use global memory card files, but split states, so
#  probably don't want to do it for that one.
#  - Dolphin: Uncertain, need to figure out what its files are.
#  - Figure out how restoring will work. Can I restore the latest of
#  everything, or the latest save for each tagged snapshot? If I only restore
#  the latest snapshot globally, it'll be whatever game was backed up most
#  recently, which wouldn't be what I'd want, so I might need
#  a ludusavi-restic-restore script too.
