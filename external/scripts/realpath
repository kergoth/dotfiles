# realpath - Convert a relative path to an absolute path. Also verifies whether
#            path/file exists. For each path specified which exists, it prints
#            the full path to STDOUT and returns 0 if all paths exist on any
#            error or if any path doesn't exist.

# CHANGE LOG:
# 
# v0.1   2012-02-18 - Morgan Aldridge <morgant@makkintosshu.com>
#                     Initial version.
# v0.2   2012-03-26 - Morgan Aldridge
#                     Fixes to incorrect absolute paths output for '/' and any
#                     file or directory which is an immediate child of '/' (when
#                     input as an absolute path).
# v0.3   2012-11-29 - Morgan Aldridge
#                     Fix for infinite loop in usage option and local paths 
#                     incorrectly assumed to be in root directory.
# v0.4   2014-04-05 - Morgan Aldridge
#                     Increased compatibility by matching GNU realpath output
#                     for relative paths. (Thanks to https://github.com/jlsantiago0)
# v0.4.1 2019-09-14 - Morgan Aldridge
#                     Better *nix compatibility (tested OpenBSD).
# v0.5   2019-09-15 - Morgan Aldridge
#                     Fix for invalid paths outputting root path.
